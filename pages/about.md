## About DigLib Demo Collection

This site is a demo collection built on the CollectionBuilder framework.
The goal is to offer a basic, lightly edited, sample digital repository.
The metadata and details of this collection are presented for demonstration only.
Further work would need to be done to make this a production-level collection.
For example, location information and dates should be checked for accuracy and consistency, among other things.

## About the Library Content

This collection demo displays content from library-related digitized
materials from the Library of Congress.
Content and metadata for this collection were retrieved
from the Library of Congress' ["Free to Use" Libraries](https://www.loc.gov/free-to-use/libraries/)
set of images.
